Cloud Foundry Documentation
===========================

This set of materials will replace all CF documentation, for both cloudfoundry.com, vcap, and bosh, in Q1 of 2013. This information is forward looking and favors 'next generation' components which may not be applicable to existing Cloud Foundry installations.

[Using Cloud Foundry](using/index.html) For web developer pushing applications to Cloud Foundry.

[Running Cloud Foundry](running/index.html) For dev/ops people managing instances of Cloud Foundry.

Docs are a work in progress and we welcome your [help](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/docs).
