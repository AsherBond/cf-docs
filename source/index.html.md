title: Welcome to Cloud Foundry Documentation
---

This set of materials will replace all Cloud Foundry documentation, for cloudfoundry.com, vcap, and bosh, in Q1 of 2013.

This information is forward-looking and favors 'next generation' components which may not be applicable to existing Cloud Foundry installations.

Docs are a work in progress. We welcome your [contributions](http://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-docs).

For a look at our roadmap - go [here](docs/roadmap.html).

NOTE: The "CF" command-line tool is only for use with v2 of Cloud Foundry, for v1 and cloudfoundry.com, please use "VMC"
