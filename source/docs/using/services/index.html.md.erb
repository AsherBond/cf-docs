Cloud Foundry Services are any type of add-on that can be provisioned alongside your application; for example, a database or an account on a third-party SaaS provider. Cloud Foundry services are implemented with a common architecture that uses gateways and nodes.

Some services also support the concept of "binding" with an application. When a service is bound to an application, connection information and credentials specific to that service instance are placed in an environment variable `VCAP_SERVICES` in JSON format that are visible to the application process.
