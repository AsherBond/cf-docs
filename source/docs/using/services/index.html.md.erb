title: Roadmap to Using Services
---

Cloud Foundry Services are any type of add-on that can be provisioned alongside your application; for example, a database or an account on a third-party SaaS provider. Cloud Foundry services are implemented with a common architecture that uses gateways and nodes.

* [Managing Services from the Command Line](managing-services.html)
* [Tunnelling with Services](tunnelling-with-services.html)

Some services also support the concept of "binding" with an application. When a service is bound to an application, connection information and credentials specific to that service instance are placed in an environment variable `VCAP_SERVICES` in JSON format that are visible to the application process. See [Using Bound Services with an Application](using-bound-services.html) and the following sections.

* [VCAP_SERVICES Environment Variable](environment-variable.html)

### Java/JVM

* [Spring Service Bindings](spring-service-bindings.html)
* [Grails Service Bindings](grails-service-bindings.html) 
* [Lift Service BIndings](lift-service-bindings.html)

### Ruby

* [Ruby Service Bindings](ruby-service-bindings.html)

### Node.js

* [Node.js Service Bindings](node-service-bindings.html)

### Connecting External Services to Cloud Foundry

Private Cloud Foundry operators frequently ask how applications pushed to their Cloud Foundry instances can bind with external services, such as Oracle, which they operate themselves. See [Service Connector](/docs/running/architecture/services/service-connector.html).
