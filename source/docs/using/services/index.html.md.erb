Cloud Foundry Services are add-ons that can be provisioned alongside your application. Services such as a database that can be used directly by your app, but they can be anything that requires provisioning, such as an account on a third-party SaaS provider.

Some services also support the concept of "binding" with an application. When a service is bound to an application, connection information and credentials specific to that service instance are placed in an environment variable `VCAP_SERVICES` in JSON format that are visible to the application process.
