title: Using Cloud Foundry
---

Cloud Foundry is an open platform as a service, providing a choice of developer frameworks and application services. Cloud Foundry makes it faster and easier to build, test, deploy and scale applications. 

Cloud Foundry supports a number of frameworks such as Spring, Ruby on Rails, Sinatra, Scala and node.js. 

This documentation is forward looking and favors 'next generation' components which may not be applicable to existing Cloud Foundry installations.
