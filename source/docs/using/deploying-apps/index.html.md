Cloud Foundry supports many frameworks and runtimes.

| Runtime         			| Framework     							|
| :-------------  			|:------------- 							|
| Javascript	     		| Node.js 									|
| Java / JVM 				| Java Spring, Grails, Scala Lift, and Play |
| Ruby						| Rack, Rails, Sinatra						|

You can also use [Custom Buildpacks](buildpacks.html) for other runtimes and frameworks not in this list.

How you deploy your application depends on the Cloud Foundry you are targeting. 

For **run.pivotal.io**, you can follow the [Getting Started document here](../../dotcom/getting-started.html).
