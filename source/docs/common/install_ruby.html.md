Ruby can easily be installed on a variety of operating systems. See the [Ruby website](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) for more details, or the operating-system specific sections below for additional suggestions. 

* [Ruby on Linux](#linux)
* [Ruby on Mac OS X](#osx)
* [Ruby on Windows](#windows)

## <a id="linux"></a>Ruby on Linux

There are two good Ruby environment managers available for Linux and Unix-like systems - rvm and rbenv. These environment managers can make it easier to manage your Ruby environment and to keep up to date with the latest Ruby releases.

* [rbenv installation instructions](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/#installation)

Ruby can also be installed using the package manager available for each Linux distribution - `apt` on Ubuntu and Debian, `yum` on RedHat/Fedora and Centos, or `yast` on SuSE Linux. When installing using a package manager, install the "ruby" and "rubygems" packages. 

## <a id="osx"></a>Ruby on Mac OS X

OS X version 10.5 and higher ship with Ruby installed, but it may not be the latest version of Ruby. There are two good Ruby environment managers available for OS X - rvm and rbenv. These environment managers can make it easier to manage your Ruby environment and to keep up to date with the latest Ruby releases.

* [rbenv installation instructions](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/#installation)

These environment managers, or a newer version of Ruby directly, can also be installed using the [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) package manager.
