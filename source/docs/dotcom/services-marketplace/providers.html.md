## <a id='docs'></a>Documentation ##

Service providers should feel enabled to manage their own documentation. Clone the [cf-docs repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-docs) and issue pull requests to update your Marketplace Services documentation page. 

Your documentation page should reside in `source/docs/dotcom/services-marketplace`.

We've provided a template to get you started. Please include the Managing Services and Support sections with links we've included; feel free to add additional information as appropriate. If your service is bindable, you'll want to include the section on Environment Variables.
