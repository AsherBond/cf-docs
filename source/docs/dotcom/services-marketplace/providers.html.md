## Integrating With Cloud Foundry

Cloud Foundry has partnered with AppDirect for services integration with our public PaaS. Service providers interested in adding their service to the Cloud Foundry Marketplace should contact [Nima Badiey](mailto:nbadiey@gopivotal.com) for more information. 

Documentation on AppDirect's API for Cloud Foundry can be found here:

## <a id='docs'></a>Documentation ##

Service providers should feel enabled to manage their own documentation. Clone the [cf-docs repo](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-docs) and issue pull requests to update your Marketplace Services documentation page. 

Your documentation page should reside in `source/docs/dotcom/services-marketplace`.

We've provided a template to get you started. Please include the Managing Services and Support sections with links we've included; feel free to add additional information as appropriate. If your service is bindable, you'll want to include the section on Environment Variables.
