title: Installing Micro BOSH, BOSH and Cloud Foundry for Production on AWS

The main goal of this document is to guide someone with minimal experience through an end to end deployment of Cloud Foundry (CF) running on AWS EC2. Follow these steps for Deployment


In order to setup and deploy a full BOSH release there are 9 major steps:

1. [First review the glossary](/docs/running/deploying-cf/aws-ec2/glossary.html)

1. [Create an AWS Account](http://bitnami.com/tutorials/create_aws_account)  This step is only necessary if you donâ€™t already have an AWS account. Follow this link for a good tutorial on the subject.
