## Step 8 - Example apps deployed on CF

This portion is taken from Dr. Nicâ€™s [Build your own Heroku With Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/bosh-cloudfoundry/blob/master/tutorials/build-your-own-heroku-with-cloudfoundry.md) example, substitute the 1.2.3.4 with the ip address you obtained in the previous step, the one we had in the examples in this document is **107.20.148.206**

### Initialize Cloud Foundry

$ gem install cf
$ cf target http://api.1.2.3.4.xip.io
$ cf login admin
Password> eaa139af583c

$ cf create-org me
$ cf create-space production
$ cf switch-space production

### Deploy first application

$ mkdir apps
$ cd apps
$ git clone https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/cf-env.git
$ cd cf-env
$ bundle

$ cf push

## Instructions for destroying the Deployments

If you have deployed Cloud Foundry, BOSH and MicroBOSH on AWS you are incurring cost for every hour you are using the servers.  To destroy the servers:

Delete the CF deployment

#### **local$ bosh delete deployment tutorial**

Repoint the target to the MicroBOSH server and destroy the BOSH server, replace the ip address below with the one you created for the BOSH server

#### **local$ bosh target 54.204.16.249**

#### **local$ bosh delete deployment bosh**

Repoint the target to the MicroBOSH server and destroy the BOSH server, replace the ip address below with the one you created for the BOSH server

#### **local$ bosh micro delete**

Now you can deallocate the Elastic IPs that were created for CF, BOSH and MicroBOSH
